docker run -d -it --name pelle ubuntu sh -c sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'

docker exec -it pelle 'apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl' or docker exec -it pelle bash and in the container exectute same commands.

I had one problem but I am 99% sure it was with virtualbox and not with docker.

docker attach pelle

I don't know if there is any better/easier way to do this.. :(
