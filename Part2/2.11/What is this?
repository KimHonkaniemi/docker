Since I have no imagination I decided to create a container with passwordgenerator in it. 
It's a stupid idea becaues everyone can google "password gen" but at least it worked.

Here are the steps:

Created docker-compose.yml file

After the dc file was created I executed "docker-compose up" and it started to work.
And to confirm that the application works I tried to connect to localhost:8080, since that was the default port for the app.
