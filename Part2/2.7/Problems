On my laptop (ubuntu 20.04 lts) all three containers start and after "trainer" had done it's job it will exit with code 0. I can see the "getting all cucumbers/mopeds" -text during the starting process.
Backend and frontend remain powered on. Volumes seems to be working since both images will transfer. When connectin to localhost:3000 (frontend) via firefox the application starts
and I try to select the cucumber or moped image they wont open. I can see the right file is selected but to opening is the problem. I am pretty sure it has something to do with tensorflow. I tried to change it to newer and older verison.
It mentions something about nvidia cuda thing but then says "you can ignore this if you dont have a nvidia gpu. Rest of the errors are with tensorflow...

Trying to replicate this on my VirtualBox Debian 11 Bullseye it's even worse. The frontend will go up but both backend and trainer will exit immediately with exit code 132.
Tried to change the tensorflow version but it doesn't help. 


I copy&pasted this from the terminal (ubuntu laptop)
